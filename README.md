# CrimePot

##### Web app for viewing criminal activity near you.

A project that uses the data from the Crime Incident Reports provided by the Boston Police Department.

This project was designed to help people in disadvantaged areas. The crime incident reports data is 
visualized onto an accessible user interface built on Google Maps. Residents in the Boston area can use
this tool to see how safe their area is. This data can also be used to compare the safety of different areas
in Boston. This visualization meaningful because it can spread awareness of a difference in living conditions between 
different classes and neighborhoods. Our goal as a team was to make technology that improves the physical world
us: 

“Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,
Nothing is going to get better. It's not.” - Dr. Seuss, The Lorax.
